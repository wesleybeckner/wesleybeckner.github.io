I am a Chemical Engineering graduate student, [NRT](http://www.cei.washington.edu/opportunities/direct/) trainee, and [ARCS](http://seattlearcsfoundation.org/) fellow at the University of Washington. I use molecular dynamics to develop materials used for energy and medicine.

Due to the generation of extremely large datasets, my work requires "Big Data" analysis tools. The creation of these datasets are made possible by the [high performance computing](http://www.washington.edu/itconnect/research/hpc/) resources at UW.
