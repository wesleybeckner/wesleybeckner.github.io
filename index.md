I am a Chemical Engineering graduate student, [NRT](http://www.cei.washington.edu/opportunities/direct/) trainee, and [ARCS](http://seattlearcsfoundation.org/) fellow at the University of Washington. I use molecular dynamics (MD) to develop materials used for energy and medicine.

Due to the generation of extremely large datasets, my work also necessitates the use of "Big Data" analysis tools. The creation of these datasets are made possible by the [high performance computing](http://www.washington.edu/itconnect/research/hpc/) resources at UW.
